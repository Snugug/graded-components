# Graded Component

This is a code example of Filament Group's [graded component](http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grade-the-components.html).

I've added grading in for network latency as as what is prescribed in the writeup. I've also made it responsive to itself with [eq.js](https://github.com/snugug/eq.js). The Sass is a little sloppy, but I'm kinda OK with that for now.

## Installing

Run the following:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp
```

```bash
$ npm install && bower install && bundle install
```

## Running

```bash
$ gulp
```
